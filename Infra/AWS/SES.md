## Moving out of the Amazon SES sandbox

To help prevent fraud and abuse, and to help protect your reputation as a sender, we apply certain restrictions to new Amazon SES accounts.

We place all new accounts in the Amazon SES sandbox. While your account is in the sandbox, you can use all of the features of Amazon SES.
However, when your account is in the sandbox, we apply the following restrictions to your account:

- You can only send mail to verified email addresses and domains, or to the Amazon SES mailbox simulator.

- You can only send mail from verified email addresses and domains.

- You can send a maximum of 200 messages per 24-hour period.

- You can send a maximum of 1 message per second.

To request that your account be removed from the Amazon SES sandbox using the AWS Management Console, visit
